# Philosophy of Physics

## Introduction
Close your eyes (actually, read this introduction THEN
close your eyes). Try to picture in your head a typical nerdy guy:
What is he like? What is he wearing? What's his favourite hobby? Maybe
physics, maybe philosophy...? If both, congratulation! Your nerdy
guy is going to enjoy this repo.

Our aim is to build a small collection of articles about physics
and philosophy. We deliberatly decided to upload not too tecnical
yet well crafetd articles in order for them to be accessible even
by someone without a deep physical, mathematical or phylosophical
background. We hope someone interested in the connection between
these two subject finds this content useful -be it for
personal interest only, for research pourpose or pheraps to
find inspiration for a divulgation project.

## Organizzazione

Divido la repo in varie cartelle in base all'argomento trattato: fare una cartella TO-READ per ogni argomento
