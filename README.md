# Philosophy of Physics

## Introduction
Close your eyes (actually, read this introduction THEN
close your eyes). Try to picture in your head a typical nerdy guy:
What is he like? What is he wearing? What's his favourite hobby? Maybe
physics, maybe philosophy...? If both, congratulation! Your nerdy
guy is going to enjoy this repo.

Our aim is to build a small collection of articles about physics
and philosophy. We deliberately decided to upload not too technical
yet well crafted articles in order for them to be accessible even
by someone without a deep physical, mathematical or philosophical
background. We hope someone interested in the connection between
these two subject finds this content useful -be it for
personal interest only, for research purpose or perhaps to
find inspiration for a divulgation project
